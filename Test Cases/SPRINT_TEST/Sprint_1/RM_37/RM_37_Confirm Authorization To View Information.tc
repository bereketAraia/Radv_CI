“I am authorized to add and retrieve content from this site and agree to the following terms and conditions:&quot; 
  
&quot;Your MA organization is utilizing this system to validate sampled risk adjustment data that your MA organization submitted under this designated MA contract in accordance with 42 C.F.R §422.310.
