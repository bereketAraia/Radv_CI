   <description>As a Discrepant Confirmation Coder I want to open the Encoder Tool so that I can code a medical record. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-1045.1: CDAT requires the user to view the medical record submission before the Encoder Tool is enabled. 

RM-1045.2: CDAT returns all ICD codes entered into the Encoder tool. 

RM-1045.3: CDAT displays the ICD codes mapping to 2013/2014 CMS-HCCs. If an ICD-9 code does not map to a CMS-HCC CDAT displays a value of &quot;none&quot;. 

RM-1045.4: CDAT displays Additional CMS-HCCs separate from Audited CMS-HCCs. 

RM-1045.5: CDAT provides the option to sort by CMS-HCC. 

RM-1045.6: CDAT provides the option to enter a comment for each returned ICD-9 code. 

RM-1045.7: CDAT provides the option to Delete a returned ICD-9 code(s). CDAT displays the following message when a user wants to delete a returned ICD-9 code: 
Are you sure you want to delete this code? 

RM-1045.8: CDAT provides Cancel and Proceed with delete options. Cancel retains the ICD-&quot;X&quot; code(s). &quot;Proceed with delete&quot; removes the selected ICD code(s).</description>
