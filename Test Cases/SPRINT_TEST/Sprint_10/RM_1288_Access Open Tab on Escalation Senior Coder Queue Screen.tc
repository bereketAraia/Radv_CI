   <description>As an ER. Senior Coder I want to access my Open tab from the Escalation Senior Coder Queue so I can view the tasks assigned to me. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-1288.1: CDAT displays the number of tasks in the Open tab. The number of tasks decreases by one when the user submits a task and increases when they request a task.

• Coversheet ID 
• Date Escalated (&quot;MM/DD/YYYY&quot; and time &quot;XX:XX AM EST&quot;) 
• Step 
• More which displays the following information when selected: 
- Submitted By (LastName, First Name)
