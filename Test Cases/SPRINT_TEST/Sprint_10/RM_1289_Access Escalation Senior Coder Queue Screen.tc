   <description>As an ER. Senior Coder I want to access the Escalation Senior Coder Queue screen so I can view the tasks in all my queues. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-1289.1: CDAT defaults to the Open tab on the Escalation Senior Coder Queue screen upon login (if the user has the ER. Senior Coder role only) or when a user with multiple roles selects the Escalation Senior Coder Queue from the list of available authorized steps. 

RM-1289.2: CDAT provides an option for the user to select the sample year that they are authorized to access. The user can select a sample from all available authorized sample years. CDAT defaults to the most current sample year. 

RM-1289.3: CDAT displays the following tabs on the Escalation Senior Coder screen: 
- Open - displays submissions in progress or not yet started 
- In QA Panel- submissions that have been escalated to the QA Panel 
- Completed - Tasks submitted back to the original user or QA reset</description>
