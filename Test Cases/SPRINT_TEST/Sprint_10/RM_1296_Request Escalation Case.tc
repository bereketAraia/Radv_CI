   <description>As an ER. Senior Coder I want to request a task so that I can process it. 

Acceptance Criteria: 


RM-1296.1: CDAT provides an option to request a task from the Escalation Senior Coder Queue. 

RM-1296.2: A user assigned to both an ER. Senior Coder and Senior Evaluation, Invalid Confirmation, Focused Review or Discrepant Confirmation role cannot request an Escalation task that they processed at any other step except Submission Review. 

RM-1296.3: CDAT displays the following message when a user assigned to both an ER Sr. Coder and Senior Evaluation, Invalid Confirmation, Focused Review or Discrepant Confirmation tries to request an Escalation case that they previously processed at any other step (except for Review Submission): 

• No escalation cases currently available. 

RM-1296.4: CDAT displays the following message when a user assigned to both an ER Sr. Coder and Senior Evaluation, Invalid Confirmation, Focused Review or Discrepant Confirmation selects Search All Escalation Cases and attempts to open an Escalation case that they previously processed at any other step (except for Review Submission): 
• An escalation cannot be worked by a same user who previously worked on the same task. 

RM-1296.5: CDAT allows the ER. Senior Coder to request tasks from their respective MRRC organization only.</description>
