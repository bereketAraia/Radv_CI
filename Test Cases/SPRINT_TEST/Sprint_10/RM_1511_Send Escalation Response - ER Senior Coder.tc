   <description>As an ER Senior Coder I want to return an escalation case back to the user who submitted it so that they can see my resolution. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-1511.1: CDAT provides a Send Response option on the Escalation Case screen. 

RM-1511.2: CDAT displays the following message when the user selects the Send Response option: 
&quot;Are you sure you want to submit? This task cannot be recalled once it has been submitted.&quot; 

RM-1511.3: CDAT provides Yes and Cancel options for the user to confirm submission. 

RM-1511.4: If &quot;Yes&quot; is selected the task is submitted back to the Open tab of the user who escalated it. If the user to which the task is being returned to is inactive, the task is returned to the open queue from where it was originally escalated and made available to the next user who requests it. 

RM-1511.5: If &quot;Cancel&quot; is selected the user remains on the Escalation Case screen. 

RM-1511.6: CDAT displays the following message when a user attempts to submit a record without entering a response: 

A response is required. 

RM-1511.7: CDAT provides an &quot;Ok&quot; option to close the message for the user to return to the Escalation Case screen to enter a response.</description>
