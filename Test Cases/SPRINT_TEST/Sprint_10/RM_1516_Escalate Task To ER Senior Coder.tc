   <description>As a MRRC user I want to escalate a task to the ER Senior Coder so that I can receive guidance on how to process it. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-1516.1: CDAT provides an Escalate option at Intake, Focused Review and Discrepant Confirmation. 

RM-1516.2: A user can only escalate a task to an ER Senior Coder from their own MRRC organization. 

RM-1516.3: CDAT displays an Escalation Reason screen when the user selects the Escalate option. 

RM-1516.4: CDAT requires the user to enter an escalation reason before submitting an escalation case to the ER Senior Coder. A maximum of 2,000 characters is allowed for the escalation reason. 

RM-1516.5: CDAT provides an escalation reason comments textbox which displays the following message until a user enters an escalation reason: 

&quot;Required - Type comments here. 2000 character limit.&quot; 

RM-1516.6: CDAT provides a &quot;Continue Working&quot; option for the user to resume processing a task without escalating it. 

RM-1516.7: CDAT provides a &quot;Submit&quot; option which sends the task to the ER Senior Coder when selected and an escalation reason has been entered. 

RM-1516.8: CDAT sends the user back to their CCQ Open tab after submitting an escalation case.</description>
