   <description>As a Focused Review Coder I want to open the Encoder Tool so that I can code a medical record. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-983.1: CDAT requires the user to view the medical record submission before the Encoder Tool is enabled. 

RM-983.2: CDAT returns all ICD-&quot;X&quot; codes entered into the Encoder tool. 

RM-983.3: CDAT displays the ICD-9 codes mapping to 2013/2014 CMS-HCCs. If an ICD code does not map to a CMS-HCC CDAT displays a value of &quot;none&quot;. 

RM-983.4: CDAT displays Additional CMS-HCCs separate from Audited CMS-HCCs. 

RM-983.5: CDAT provides the option to sort by CMS-HCC. 

RM-983.6: CDAT provides the option to enter a comment for each returned ICD code. 

RM-983.7: CDAT provides the option to Delete a returned ICD-&quot;X&quot; code(s). CDAT displays the following message when a user wants to delete a returned ICD-&quot;X&quot; code: 
Are you sure you want to delete this code? 

RM-983.8: CDAT provides Cancel and Proceed with delete options. Cancel retains the ICD-&quot;X&quot; code(s). &quot;Proceed with delete&quot; removes the selected ICD code(s).</description>
