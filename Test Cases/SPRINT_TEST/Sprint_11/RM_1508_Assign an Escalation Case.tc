   <description>As an ER Senior Coder I want to assign myself an escalation case so that I can resolve it. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-1508.1: CDAT provides an &quot;Assign to Me&quot; option for Escalation Cases where Status = Unassigned after the user conducts a search. 

RM-1508.2: CDAT moves the Escalation Case to the user's Open Queue when they select the &quot;Assign to Me&quot; option. There is no limit to the number of Escalation cases a user can assign to themselves. 

RM-1508.3: CDAT displays the following message when a user assigned to both an ER Sr. Coder and Senior Evaluation, Invalid Confirmation, Focused Review or Discrepant Confirmation selects Search All Escalation Cases and attempts to open an Escalation case that they previously processed at any other step (except for Review Submission): 
â€¢ An escalation cannot be worked by a same user who previously worked on the same task. - BASED ON MRRC AND CMS RESPONSES THIS MAY NOT BE APPLICABLE> THE ONLY EXCLUSION IS A USER CANNOT ESCALATE TO THEMSELF></description>
