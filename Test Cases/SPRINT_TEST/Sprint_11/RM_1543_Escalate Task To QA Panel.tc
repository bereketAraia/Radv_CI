   <description>As an ER Senior Coder I want to escalate a task to the QA Panel so that I can receive guidance on how to process it. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-1543.1: CDAT provides an Escalate To QA Panel option on the Escalation Case screen. 

RM-1543.2: CDAT displays an Escalation Reason screen when the user selects the Escalate To QA Panel option. An ER Senior Coder can select the PHI/PII checkbox if they believe that a potential for a PHI/PII issue exists. 

RM-1543.3: CDAT requires the user to enter an escalation reason before submitting an escalation case to the QA Panel. A maximum of 2,000 characters is allowed for the escalation reason. 

RM-1543.4: CDAT provides a &quot;Escalate To QA Panel&quot; option which sends the task to the QA Panel when selected. 

RM-1543.5: CDAT displays the following message when a user tries to submit an escalation without entering a reason: 

&quot;You must enter a reason for escalation.&quot; 

RM-1543.6: CDAT provides a &quot;Continue Working&quot; option for the user to resume processing a task without escalating it. 

RM-1543.7: CDAT sends the ER Senior Coder back to the Open tab on the Escalation Senior Coder Queue after submitting an escalation case to the QA Panel. The escalation case displays in the &quot;In QA Panel&quot; tab on the Escalation Senior Coder Queue until it is returned from the QA Panel. The escalation case displays in the Completed Tab of the Escalation Senior Coder Queue if the QA Panel resets it back to Submission Review.</description>
