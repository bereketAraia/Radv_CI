   <description>As a QA Panel Editor I want to open an escalation case so that I can process it. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-1553.1: CDAT allows the user to open a task by selecting the Escalation Case ID on the QA Panel screen. QA Panel members have read only access. 

RM-1553.2: CDAT appends an open task with &quot;Potential PHI/PII Issue&quot; in the Status column if an ER Sr. Coder selected the Potential PHI/PII checkbox an escalation reason. 

RM-1553.3: CDAT directs the user to the Escalation Case screen with the Details tab displayed by default when the user selects a task's Escalation Case ID. 

RM-1553.4: CDAT allows multiple QA Panel members to view the same record concurrently. 

RM-1553.5: CDAT allows for the first QA Panel Editor that opens the record to have write access to the record, and any subsequent QA Panel Editors that open the record to have read only access.</description>
