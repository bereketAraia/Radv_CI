   <description>As a QA Panel Editor I want to return an escalation case back to the user who submitted it so that they can see my resolution. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-1757.1: CDAT provides a Send Response option on the Escalation Case screen. 


RM-1757.2: The QA Panel Editor is required to enter a response before submitting the task back to the ER Senior Coder who escalated it. CDAT provides an escalation reason comments textbox which displays the following message until a user enters an escalation reason response: 

 &quot;Type comments here. 2000 character limit.&quot; 

RM-1757.3: CDAT displays the following message when the user selects the Send Response option: 
&quot;Are you sure you want to submit? This task cannot be recalled once it has been submitted.&quot; 

RM-1757.4: CDAT provides a &quot;Continue Working&quot; option for the user to resume processing a task without escalating sending an escalation response. 

RM-1757.5: CDAT provides a &quot;Send Response&quot; option which sends the task back to the ER Senior Coder when selected and an escalation reason response has been entered. 

RM-1757.6: CDAT sends the user back to their QA Panel Queue Open tab after submitting an escalation case.</description>
