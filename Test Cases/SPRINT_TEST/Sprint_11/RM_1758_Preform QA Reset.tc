   <description>As a QA Panel Editor I want to reset an escalation case back to Submission Review so that it can be reprocessed by different MRRC users. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-1758.1: CDAT provides a Reset option on the Escalation Case screen. QA Panel reset cannot be performed at Intake (Steps 2, 3 and 4). 

RM-1758.2: A reason must be provided for performing a QA reset. CDAT displays a QA Reset reason comments text box when the user selects the Reset option, which displays the following message until a user enters a QA Reset reason: 

 &quot;Required - Type comments here. 2000 character limit.&quot; 

RM-1758.3: CDAT displays the following message when the user selects the Reset option: 
&quot;Are you sure you would like to reset this submission? The task cannot be recalled once it has been submitted.&quot; 

 RM-1758.4: CDAT provides Reset Submission and Continue Working options for the user to confirm submission. 

RM-1758.5: If &quot; Reset Submission &quot; is selected the task is submitted back to Submission Review and the user is directed back to the QA Panel screen. 

RM-1758.6: If &quot;Continue Working&quot; is selected the user remains on the QA Panel screen. 

RM-1758.7: A task that is reset by the QA Panel Editor is cleared of comments and coding entries except for all QA Panel Editorâ€™s reset comments. 

RM-1758.8: A task that is reset by the QA Panel Editor cannot be assigned to any user who previously requested the task. 

RM-1758.9: CDAT retains all prior exclusions, including the MRRC-level exclusions, after a Focused Review or Discrepant Confirmation QA Panel reset.</description>
