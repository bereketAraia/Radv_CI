   <description>As a PM user I want to reset a task so that it can be available to a different user for processing. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-1760.1: CDAT provides a Reset Submission option on the PM Reset screen for a PM to perform a PM reset at any step on a task under review by their MRRC organization. 

RM-1760.2: CDAT restricts a PM from performing a PM Reset on a task that is locked to a user of another contractor. 

RM-1760.3: CDAT does not allow a PM to reset a task that has been escalated to the QA Panel and opened by a QA Panel Editor (an unopened task that is in the QA Panel queue can be PM reset). 


RM-1760.4: A reason must be provided for performing a PM reset. CDAT provides a PM Reset reason comments textbox which displays the following message until a user enters a PM Reset reason: 

 &quot;Required - Type comments here. 2000 character limit.&quot; 

RM-1760.5: CDAT displays the following message when the user selects the Reset option: 
&quot;Are you sure you would like to reset this submission? The task cannot be recalled once it has been submitted.&quot; 


RM-1760.6: CDAT provides Reset Submission and Cancel options for the user to confirm submission. 

RM-1760.7: If &quot;Reset Submission&quot; is selected the task is submitted back to the open queue of the step from where it was reset and cannot be assigned to any coder who has previously worked on the record at the same step where the reset was performed. 

RM-1760.8: If &quot;Cancel&quot; is selected the user remains on the PM Reset screen. 

RM-1760.9: CDAT removes comments entered and any work performed by the current assigned user upon PM reset. 

RM-1760.10: CDAT restricts the task from being assigned to any user who has been assigned the task at the same step where the reset was performed after a PM reset (this is handled through the CCQ) 

RM-1760.11: CDAT retains escalation case information after the PM reset. 

RM-1760.12: CDAT records the date and time when the PM reset took place.</description>
