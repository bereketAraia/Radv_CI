   <description>As a Research Management user I want to view search results so that I can select a record to open.

Acceptance Criteria:

RM-3249.1: Given that a user has entered search criteria and selected the Search option CDAT displays the search results:

• Current Step
• In Escalation (values: Yes/No)
• Coversheet ID
• Submission Date (MM/DD/YYYY)
• File Format Issue (values: Yes/No/NA/Blank)
• Issue (values: Yes/No)
• More which displays the following information when selected:

- MRRC Organization (allows searching for records that were processed by the same MRRC organization at any step within the workflow.)
- Assigned To (LastName FirstName of the reviewer if the task is assigned to a user even if the user has not opened the task. CDAT displays &quot;Unassigned&quot; if a task is in the CCQ and it has not been assigned to a user (except for tasks in escalation). Unassigned will also display if the record is at CDAT-End. “QA Panel” if the task is being worked or waiting to be worked by a QA Panel Editor.)

RM-3249.2: CDAT hides the search and filter menu so results are displayed in full.

RM-3249.3: CDAT provides a Clear All option for the user to clear selected search criteria and/or filters.</description>
