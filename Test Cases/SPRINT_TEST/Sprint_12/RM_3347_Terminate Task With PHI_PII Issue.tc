   <description>As a QA Panel Editor I want to terminate a task with a PHI/PII issue so that it can be removed from the system.

Acceptance Criteria:

RM-3347.1: Given that the user has opened a task from the QA Panel screen and selected the Respond tab, CDAT provides a PHI/PII Issue Found option.

RM-3347.2: CDAT displays a PHI/PII Issue found pop up when the QA Panel Editor selects the PHI/PII Issue Found option.

RM-3347.3: CDAT displays the following text on the PHI/PII Issue found pop up:

The panel has determined that this submission contains a PHI/PII issue.
Action required: create a support ticket to remove this submission from the system.

RM-3347.4: CDAT requires the QA Panel Editor to enter a support ticket number before submitting the task for termination.</description>
