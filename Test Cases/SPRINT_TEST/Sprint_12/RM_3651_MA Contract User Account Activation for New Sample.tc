   <description>As an existing MA contract user I want to register an account for a new sample in CDAT so that my account can be activated for the sample. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-3651.1: CDAT requires the user to enter the following information: 

• First Name 
• Last Name 
• Email Address 

RM-3651.2: CDAT validates the information against a database of usernames and email addresses provided by the Communications Contractor. 

RM-3651.3: If the account is disabled, CDAT verifies if the user already had an account from a previous audit and updates the active directory account information to enable it. The user receives an email after 24 hours of registration to confirm that their account has been activated.</description>
