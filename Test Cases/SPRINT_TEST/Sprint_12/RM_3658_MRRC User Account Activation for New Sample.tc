   <description>As an existing MRRC user I want to register an account for a new sample in CDAT so that my account can be activated for the sample.

Acceptance Criteria:

RM-3658.1: CDAT requires the user to enter the following information:

• First Name
• Last Name
• Email Address

RM-3658.2: CDAT validates the information against a database of usernames and email addresses provided by the MRRC organization.

RM-3658.3: If the account is disabled, CDAT verifies if the user already had an account from a previous audit and updates the active directory account information to enable it. The user receives an email after 24 hours of registration to confirm that their account has been activated.</description>
