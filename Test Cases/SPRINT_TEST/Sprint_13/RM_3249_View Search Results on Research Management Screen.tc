   <description>As a Research Management user I want to view search results so that I can select a record to open. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-3249.1: Given that a user has entered search criteria and selected the Search option CDAT displays the search results: 

• Current Step 
• In Escalation (values: Yes/No) 
• Coversheet ID 
• Submission Date (MM/DD/YYYY) 
• File Format Issue (values: Yes/No/NA/Blank) 
• Issue (values: Yes/No/NA/Blank) 
• More which displays the following information when selected: 
- HMOID 
- Enrollee ID 
- Coversheet Rank 
- Error Type - DELETE. APPLICABLE TO RECON 
- Visit Type (values: Outpatient (Physician, Specialist, Hospital Outpatient, Observation or Inpatient (Hospital Only) 
- Electronic Medical Record 
- Compliant Medical Record (values: Yes/No) 
- CMS-Generated Attestation (values: Yes/No) 
- Attestation Valid (values: Yes/No) 
- Audited CMS-HCC 
- QA Reset (values: Yes/No) 
- PM Reset (values: Yes/No) 
- MRRC Organization (allows searching for records that were processed by the same MRRC organization at any step within the workflow.) - DELETE. SEARCH CRITERIA ONLY. IT SHOULD NOT BE A DATA POINT. 
- Assigned To (LastName FirstName of the reviewer if the task is assigned to a user even if the user has not opened the task. CDAT displays &quot;Unassigned&quot; if a task is in the CCQ and it has not been assigned to a user (except for tasks in escalation). Unassigned will also display if the record is at CDAT-End. “QA Panel” if the task is being worked or waiting to be worked by a QA Panel Editor.) 

RM-3249.2: CDAT hides the search and filter menu so results are displayed in full. 

RM-3249.3: CDAT provides a Clear All option for the user to clear selected search criteria and/or filters.</description>
