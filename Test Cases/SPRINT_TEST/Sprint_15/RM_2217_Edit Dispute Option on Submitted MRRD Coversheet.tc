   <description>As an MA contract user I want to edit the dispute option on a submitted coversheet so that I can submit the correct selection.

Acceptance Criteria:

RM-2217.1: Given that a user has submitted an MRRD coversheet, CDAT enables the Edit option when the user opens the submitted MRRD Coversheet. The Edit option is disabled after the submission deadline has passed.

RM-2217.2: CDAT allows the user to change the dispute option up until the end of the 60 day submission period (or extended submission period if applicable).

RM-2217.3: CDAT removes the medical record selected and justification entered by the MA contract user when they change selection from Dispute is being submitted for [CMS-HCC] to No Dispute is being submitted for [CMS-HCC].

RM-2217.4: CDAT overwrites the previous dispute option with any revision prior to the submission deadline (or extended submission deadline if applicable).</description>
