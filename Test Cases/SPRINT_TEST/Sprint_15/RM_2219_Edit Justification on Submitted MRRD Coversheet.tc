   <description>As an MA contract user I want to edit the justification text on a submitted coversheet so that I can make any changes necessary.

Acceptance Criteria:

RM-2219.1: Given that a user has submitted an MRRD coversheet and selected the &quot;Dispute is being submitted for [CMS-HCC]&quot; option when editing an MRRD coversheet, CDAT allows the user to change the justification text up until the end of the 60 day submission period (or extended submission period if applicable).

RM-2219.2: The previous MRRD justification entry is overwritten with any revisions prior to the submission deadline (or extended submission deadline if applicable).</description>
