   <description>As an I-RMC I want to open a record with a PHI/PII issue so that I can view recommendations from the QA Panel Editor. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-5252.1: Given that a QA Panel Editor has approved the deletion of a page(s) in a record CDAT allows the I-RMC to open the submission for processing. 

RM-5252.2: CDAT removes all comments and the record is treated like a QA Reset if that record is escalated past Step 2. CDAT displays the PHI/PII comments.</description>
