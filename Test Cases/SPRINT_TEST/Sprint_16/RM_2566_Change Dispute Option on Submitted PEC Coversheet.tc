   <description>As an MA contract user I want to edit the dispute option on a PEC submitted coversheet so that I can change my previous selection. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-2566.1: Given that a user has submitted a PEC coversheet, CDAT enables the Edit option when the user opens the submitted PEC Coversheet. 

RM-2566.2: CDAT allows the user to change the dispute option up until the end of the 60-day submission period (or extended submission period if applicable). 

RM-2566.3: CDAT removes the justification entered by the MA contract user when they change selection from &quot;PEC dispute is being submitted for this MA Contract&quot; to &quot;No PEC dispute is being submitted for this MA Contract&quot;. 

RM-2566.4: CDAT overwrites the previous dispute option with any revision prior to the submission deadline (or extended submission deadline if applicable).</description>
