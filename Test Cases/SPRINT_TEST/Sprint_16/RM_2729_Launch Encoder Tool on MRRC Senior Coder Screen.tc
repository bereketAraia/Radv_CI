   <description>As a MRRC Senior Coder I want to open the Encoder Tool so that I can code a medical record. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-2729.1: CDAT provides an Open Encoder Tool option for the MRRC Senior Coder to launch the Encoder Tool to return the ICD-9-CM codes that map to the disputed CMS-HCC. 

RM-2729.2: CDAT displays the following CMS-HCC information after the Encoder Tool has returned the ICD-9-CM codes that map to the Disputed CMS-HCC if the medical record selected for MRRD Reconsideration was deemed invalid during the Contract sample's intake process: 
•	CMS-HCC 
•	ICD-9 Code 
•	ICD-9 Code Description 

Note: The most current version of the ICD codes will be displayed in CDAT. When ICD-10 codes are introduced then CDAT will display those.</description>
