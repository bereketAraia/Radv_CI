   <description>As a MRRC Senior Coder I want to filter disputes on the CCQ so that I can view only those relevant to my needs.

Acceptance Criteria:

RM-2715.1: CDAT provides an option to filter by the following step values on the CCQ:

-MRRC Senior Coder
-Technical Writer

RM-2715.2: CDAT does not display filter options when there is no data to display. For example if a user is authorized to process tasks at the MRRC Senior Coder step only then the filter option is not available.

RM-2715.3: CDAT provides an option to clear selected filters and return to the default dispute listing.</description>
