   <description>As a Technical Writer I want to view the manipulated MRR medical record and Coversheet associated with the MRRD appeal so that I can use the information to process the task.

Acceptance Criteria:

RM-2811.1: CDAT displays the manipulated MRR medical record and Coversheet (page-numbered) associated with the MRRD appeal when the user selects View Medical Record option on the Details or Verify tabs.

Note: A user cannot download the PDF on to their local hard drive. CDAT displays the medical record in a new window and can only be viewed using the PDF viewer within the browser.</description>
