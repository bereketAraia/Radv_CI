   <description>As a MRRC Senior Coder I want to return a task back to the Technical Writer so that my updates can be reviewed.

Acceptance Criteria:

RM-3102.1: CDAT returns the task back to the Technical Writer who originally sent the feedback when the user selects Complete.

RM-3102.2: The task is assigned to the open Technical Writer queue if the original Technical Writerâ€™s account is inactive.

RM-3102.3: A task originally escalated by the Technical Writer to the QA Panel and returned to the MRRC Senior Coder for updates goes through another technical writer review by the original Technical Writer after modifications are made by the MRRC Senior Coder.</description>
