   <description>As a MRRC Senior Coder I want to submit an escalation task to the QA Panel so that it can get resolved. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-3106.1: CDAT provides a &quot;Submit&quot; option which sends the task to the QA Panel when selected and an escalation reason has been entered. 

RM-3106.2: CDAT provides a &quot;Continue Working&quot; option for the user to resume processing a task without escalating it. 

RM-3106.3: CDAT sends the user back to their CCQ Open tab after submitting an escalation case.</description>
