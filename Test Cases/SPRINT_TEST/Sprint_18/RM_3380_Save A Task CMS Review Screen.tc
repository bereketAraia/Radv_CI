   <description>As a CMS user I want to save an open task so that I can keep my changes.

Acceptance Criteria:

RM-3380.1: CDAT saves the changes made and displays the following message when the user selects the Save option (the save option is not enabled until the user has entered new text or made a new selection):

&quot;Your changes have been saved.&quot;

RM-3380.2: CDAT reloads the same data when a user who previously saved it returns to work on the task later.

RM-3380.3: CDAT reloads the same data when a user toggles between tabs within the same record.</description>
