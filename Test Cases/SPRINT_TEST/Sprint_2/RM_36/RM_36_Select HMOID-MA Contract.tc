   <description>As an MA organization user I want to select the Health Maintenance Organization Identification Number- Medicare Advantage (HMOID-MA) Contract so that I can view the enrollee data for the selected HMOID. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-36.1: CDAT displays all the HMOIDs available for selection which the user is authorized to access upon acceptance of the terms and conditions. 

RM-36.2: CDAT displays the following information on the HMOID selection screen: 
•	Progress (Shows stats on Completed, In Progress and Not Started enrollees) 
•	Contract Name 
•	Enrollee List (downloadable enrollee list) 
•	More (displays additional files for download)

RM-36.4: CDAT allows the user to sort by Contract Name. 

RM-36.5: CDAT disables the More option if there is no additional information to be displayed.</description>
