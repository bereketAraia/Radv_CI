   <description>As an MA organization user I want to know if an issue exists for an enrollee's medical record so I can correct it. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-41.1: CDAT populates the Issue column on the List of Enrollees screen after Intake is complete with the following values: 
•	Yes – when any of the submissions have an Issue 
•	No - when none of the submissions have an issue for the enrollee 
•	&lt;blank> - when any submission's validity has not yet been determined. 

NOTE: THIS USER STORY CANNOT BE FULLY TESTED UNTIL THE ENTIRE INTAKE MODULE IS BUILT. TO TEST THIS FOR SPRINT 2 JUST VERIFY THAT THE ISSUE COLUMN EXISTS ON THE LIST OF ENROLLEES SCREEN.</description>
