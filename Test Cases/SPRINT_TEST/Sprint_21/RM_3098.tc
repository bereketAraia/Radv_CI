   <description>As a MRRC Senior Coder I want to access a task returned from the Technical Writer so that I can view the feedback.

Acceptance Criteria:

RM-3098.1: Given that the Technical Writer has sent a task back to a MRRC Senior Coder, CDAT displays the tasks in the MRRC Senior Coder's Open tab.

RM-3098.2: CDAT marks the task as &quot;Returned from Technical Writer&quot;. CDAT displays the user role category from where the task is being returned.

RM-3098.3: The task is sent to the open MRRC Senior Coder queue if the original MRRC Senior Coderâ€™s account is inactive.</description>
