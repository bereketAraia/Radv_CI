   <description>As an MA organization user I want to select the visit type so I can enter the dates of service from the Medical Record. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-286.1: CDAT requires a user to select only one visit type from the following options: 

- Outpatient (Physician, Specialist, Hospital Outpatient, Observation; Single visit Type) 
- Inpatient (Hospital Only, Admissions &amp; Discharge Dates) 

RM-286.2: CDAT requires the user to enter a date of service for an Outpatient visit type. 

RM-286.3: CDAT requires the user to enter an admission and discharge date for an Inpatient visit type. The Admission Date (Month, Day, Year) cannot not be greater than the Discharge Date (Month, Day, Year). 

RM-286.4: CDAT displays the following message when a user enters an admission date that is greater than the discharge date: 
&quot;Admission date cannot be after the discharge date.&quot; 

RM-286.5:CDAT shall displays the following message when a user enters the date in an incorrect format: 
&quot;Invalid date entered (Format: MM/DD/YYYY)&quot; 

RM-286.6: CDAT pre-populates the year with the payment year as read only for Outpatient and Inpatient Discharge Date Year. Inpatient Admission Date Year is editable. For example if a user selects CON14 then CDAT prepopulates the year with 2013 and if CON13 is selected then CDAT prepopulates the year with 2012.
