   <description>As an MA organization user I want to review the coversheet so that I can confirm if my entries are correct. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-50.1: CDAT displays the following message on the Review Coversheet screen: 
Review the information below to confirm that your coversheet selections, entries and uploaded document(s) accurately represent what you intend to submit. 

RM-50.2: CDAT displays File Format Issue status of the uploaded Medical Record. The submission cannot be downloaded if it is found to have a File Format Issue. CDAT retains previous uploaded medical record that do not have a FIle Format Issue. 

RM-50.3: CDAT displays the medical record PDF file name. 

RM-50.4: CDAT displays the uploaded Medical Record file type (i.e Medical Record; Medical Record and CMS-generated Attestation or No Medical Record). If there is no medical record uploaded CDAT should display &quot;No Medical Record&quot; and should remove the any upload success/failure text. 

RM-50.5: CDAT displays the visit type and dates of service. 

RM-50.6: CDAT displays the Enrollee's Name and date of birth (Corrected name and DOB if applicable). 

RM-50.7: CDAT provides an Edit option for the user to make changes to the coversheet before submission. 

RM-50.8: CDAT displays the Single Form of the completed coversheet when the user selects the Edit option. CDAT retains the user's edits for submission. The user MUST select a file again. This is a security feature of all web browsers. Once they do that, the form is populated. Toggling between the Upload Type and the Visit Type will NOT reset the form since the user is editing it. 

RM-50.9: CDAT displays the following message when a user selects CANCEL: 
&quot;If you proceed with cancelling, this Coversheet will not be saved.&quot; The user is required to select &quot;Proceed with Cancel&quot; or &quot;Resume Coversheet&quot;. 

RM-50.10: CDAT sends the user back to the Enrollee Submission Management screen if they select &quot;Proceed with Cancel&quot;. The user is kept on the Coversheet screen if they select &quot;Resume Coversheet&quot;. 

RM-50.11: CDAT provides a SUBMIT option for the user to submit a coversheet.</description>
