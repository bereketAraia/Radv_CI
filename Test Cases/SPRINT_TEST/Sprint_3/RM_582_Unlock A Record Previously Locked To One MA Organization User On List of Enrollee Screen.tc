   <description>As an MA organization user I want to know if an enrollee previously locked to another user is available so that I can access the enrollee. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-582.1: CDAT allows a user to open an enrollee that was previously worked on by another user in their MA organization when that enrollee is not locked to another user. 

RM-582.2: CDAT removes the &quot;Locked&quot; status in the Progress column on the List of Enrollees screen when a user who actively worked on the enrollee closes closes out of the Enrollee Submission Management screen. 

RM-582.3 CDAT checks for any previously existing locks when a user locks a particular enrollee, and automatically unlocks the previously locked enrollee(s). One user can only lock one enrollee at a time.</description>
