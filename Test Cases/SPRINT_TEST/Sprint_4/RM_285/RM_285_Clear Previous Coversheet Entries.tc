   <description>As an MA organization user I want CDAT to clear all non-pre-populated sections in the coversheet when I change a previous selection prior to submission. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-285.1: CDAT clears all non-prepopulated coversheet entries when a user changes the Upload Type from its original selection prior to submitting the coversheet. 

RM-285.2: CDAT removes the Medical Record file when a user changes the Upload Type. 

RM-285.3: CDAT displays the following alert when the user changes the Upload Type: 

- &quot;Changing the Upload Type will remove the current Medical Record and will require you to upload a new Medical Record file &quot; (not applicable when &quot;No Medical Record&quot; is selected) 
  
RM-285.4: CDAT provides the user with an option to Cancel the action to change Upload Type. 

RM-285.5: CDAT clears dates of service entries when a user changes the Visit Type from its original selection prior to submitting the coversheet.</description>
