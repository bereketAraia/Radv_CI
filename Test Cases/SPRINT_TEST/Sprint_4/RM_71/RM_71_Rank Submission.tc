   <description>As an MA organization user I want CDAT to automatically assign a rank to a Coversheet with an attached medical record so that I can define an order of priority for each submission. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-71.1: CDAT automatically assigns each new submission with a submission rank = 1 except for submissions with an upload type = No Medical Record. Subsequent submissions for that enrollee will automatically move down one level in priority. 

RM-71.2: CDAT automatically assigns rank = 0 for a submission with No medical record attached. The submission displays a default value of 0 on the Enrollee Submission Management Screen. No medical record submissions will not count against the total number of submissions allowed for that enrollee.</description>
