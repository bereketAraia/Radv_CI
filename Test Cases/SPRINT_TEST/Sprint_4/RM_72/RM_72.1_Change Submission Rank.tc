   <description>As an MA organization user, I want to change the rank for coversheets with attached medical records so that I can modify the order of priority for a coversheet. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-72.1: CDAT provides a &quot;Change Rank&quot; option on the Enrollee Submission Management screen. 

RM-72.2: CDAT does not allow the MA organization user to &quot;Change Rank&quot; of a coversheet when no medical record is attached. The submission displays a default value of 0 on the Enrollee Submission Management screen. 

RM-72.3: CDAT moves existing coversheets one level up or down in priority when a user changes rank. For example, if a user changes a coversheet's rank from 2 to 1 then the original coversheet rank of 1 moves down to a coversheet rank of 2 and vice versa. 

RM-72.4: CDAT disables the option for a user to change rank on a coversheet where the No Medical Record upload type is selected. 

RM-72.5: CDAT disables the &quot;Change Rank&quot; option if there is only one coversheet. 

RM-72.6: CDAT disables the &quot;Change Rank&quot; option for an enrollee marked as complete. The user must de-select the &quot;Marked As Complete&quot; option to be able to change the rank during the submission period.</description>
