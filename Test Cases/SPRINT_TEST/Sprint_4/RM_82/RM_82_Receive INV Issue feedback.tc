   <description>As an MA organization user I want to receive feedback when a file I submit does not meet INV validation checks so that I can submit a valid medical record. 

 Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-82.1: CDAT displays an Issue column on the Enrollee Submission Management screen with the following values: 
- Yes - when the submission has an issue 
- No - when the submission does not have an issue 
- N/A - when the submission is specified as “No Medical Record” or when File Format Issue equals &quot;Yes&quot; 
- &lt;blank> - when the submission’s validity has not yet been determined 

RM-82.2: CDAT displays the following INV dispositions, for INV questions marked as “No” at intake, on the Coversheet screen when the user selects the coversheet from the Enrollee Submission Management screen. INV questions invalid feedback is only available to the MA organization after the Invalid Confirmation step is complete. Only an invalid medical record triggers the Issue option if the medical record is deemed invalid during the Invalid Confirmation step: 

-INV17 - Something other than a MR is attached 
-INV 1 - Wrong record/no name 
-INV 3 - Name Variation 
-INV 4 - Date Missing 
-INV 14 - Date outside data collection period

-INV 7 - Credentials missing 
-INV20 - &lt;comment entered by the user during Senior Evaluation or Confirm Invalid step></description>
