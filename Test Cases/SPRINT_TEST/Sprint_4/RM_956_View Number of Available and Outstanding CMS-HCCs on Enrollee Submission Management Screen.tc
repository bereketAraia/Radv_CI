   <description>As an MA organization user I want to view the number of audited CMS-HCCs on the Enrollee Submission Management screen so that I can know how many I need to submit. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-956.1: CDAT displays the audited blended 20XX/20XX CMS-HCCs. For example CON15 would display 2014/2015 CMS-HCCs. 

RM-956.2: CDAT displays outstanding 20XX/20XX CMS-HCCs 

RM-956.3: CDAT updates the number of CMS-HCCs Outstanding every time the MA contract submits a Medical Record Coversheet (including when a plan submits a Medical Record Coversheet indicating No Medical Record will be submitted for that CMS-HCC) on the Enrollee Submission Management screen.</description>
