• Coversheet ID 
• Name 
• DOB 
• Enrollee ID 
• HMOID 
• MA Contract 
• Submitted By and Date/Time 

RM-98.2: CDAT displays the following information on the Coversheet Summary page:

• Uploaded Medical Record, if applicable 
• Upload Type (Medical Record, Medical Record and CMS-Generated Attestation or No Medical Record)

RM-98.3: CDAT allows the user to open the submitted Medical Record. 

RM-98.4: CDAT provides the option for the user to download the Coversheet with Medical Record. The download option is disabled if there is a File Format Issue. A No Medical Record submission will download the coversheet only.
