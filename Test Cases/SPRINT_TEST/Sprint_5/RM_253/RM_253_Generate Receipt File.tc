   <description>As an MA organization user I want to view the Receipt file so I can look at submissions for an enrollee.

Acceptance Criteria: 
  
RM-253.1: CDAT enables the Download CMS Receipt file option on the Enrollee Submission Management screen when a user marks the enrollee as complete. 

RM-253.2: CDAT provides the user the following options when they select Download CMS Receipt: 
Open - Opens the CMS Receipt PDF file 
Save - Saves the CMS Receipt PDF file to a location on the user’s hard drive 
Cancel – The user remains on the Enrollee Submission Management screen 

RM-253.3: CDAT displays the unranked submissions (i.e. submissions with “No MR” submitted), below the ranked submissions on the CMS Receipt file. The ranked submissions display in order of priority (1 is the highest rank and will display first). 

RM-253.4: CDAT displays the following information on the CMS Receipt file:
