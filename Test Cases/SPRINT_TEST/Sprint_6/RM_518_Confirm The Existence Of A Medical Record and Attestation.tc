   <description>As an I-RMC I want to confirm the existence of a medical record and attestation so that the task can be processed correctly. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-518.1: CDAT requires the user to check all options that are applicable to the submission from the following selections: 
•A non-CMS-Generated Attestation 
•A CMS-Generated Attestation 
•No Attestation 
•A medical record 
•No medical record 

RM-518.2: CDAT only allows the user to select one attestation option at a time. For example, if the user selects &quot;A non-CMS-Generated Attestation&quot; they cannot select &quot;A CMS-Generated Attestation&quot; and/or &quot;No Attestation&quot; at the same time. 

RM-518.3: CDAT allows the user to select &quot;A medical record&quot; or &quot;No medical record&quot; but not both at the same time.</description>
