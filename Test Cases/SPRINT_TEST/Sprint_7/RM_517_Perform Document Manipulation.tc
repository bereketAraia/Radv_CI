   <description>As an I-RMC I want to perform document manipulation on a submission so that I can fix pages that do not display correctly. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-517.1: CDAT provides an option for a user to rotate individual pages by the following degrees: 
•90 degrees clock wise 
•90 degrees counter-clock 
•180 degrees 

RM-517.2: CDAT provides an option for a user to rotate all pages in one action by the following degrees: 
•90 degrees clock wise 
•90 degrees counter-clock 
•180 degrees 

RM-517.3: CDAT displays the number of pages in the submission. 

RM-517.4: CDAT provides a Thumbnail option which allows a user to view the submission as multiple small pages or single larger page.


this user story should not be automated or atleast at the moment!!</description>
