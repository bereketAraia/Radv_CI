   <description>As an Intake Sr Evaluator I want to confirm the existence of a medical record and attestation so that the task can be processed correctly. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-568.1: CDAT requires the user to check all options that are applicable to the submission from the following selections: 
•A CMS-Generated Attestation 
•A non-CMS-Generated Attestation 
•No Attestation 
•A medical record 
•No medical record (INV 17) 

RM-568.2: CDAT only allows the user to select one attestation option at a time. For example, if the user selects &quot;A non-CMS-Generated Attestation&quot; they cannot select &quot;A CMS-Generated Attestation&quot; and/or &quot;No Attestation&quot; at the same time. 

RM-568.3: CDAT allows the user to select &quot;A medical record&quot; or &quot;No medical record (INV 17)&quot; but not both at the same time. 


RM-568.4: CDAT retains the attestation selection even if a user selects &quot;No medical record (INV 17)&quot; . 

RM-568.5: CDAT removes the ability for the user to complete the following fields when No medical record (INV 17) is selected: 
• Edit Attestation date of service 
• Select CMS-generated Attestation invalidity reasons 
• Edit Medical Record dates of service 
• Select how the Medical Record was created (Electronic Medical Record (EMR)) 
• Select issues with Medical Record 
• Answer invalidity questions 

RM-568.6: CDAT requires the user to enter a comment when No medical record (INV 17) is selected.
