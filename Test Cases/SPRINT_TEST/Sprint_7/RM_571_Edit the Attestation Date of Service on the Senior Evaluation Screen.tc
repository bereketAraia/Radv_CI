   <description>As an Intake Senior Evaluator I want to change the date of service so that I can match it to the date on the Attestation. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-571.1: CDAT provides the user with an option to enter the Attestation Date. 

RM-571.2: CDAT allows the user to edit the Attestation Date of Service. The user can edit the month, day or year. 

RM-571.3: CDAT requires the user to enter the correct date format, MM/DD/YYYY 

RM-571.4: CDAT displays the following message when a user enters an incorrect date format: 

Invalid date entered. Date must be in MM/DD/YYYY format. 

RM-571.5: CDAT validates that the Attestation Date cannot be after 12/31 of the sample year and displays the following message if the attestation dates are after 12/31 of the sample year: 
&quot;Attestation date cannot be greater than 12/31/XXXX.&quot; 

RM-571.6: CDAT does not display the Attestation Date of Service when the user confirms that No Attestation exists.</description>
