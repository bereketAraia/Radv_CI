   <description>As an Intake Senior Evaluator I want to return a task with a Document Issue to Submission review so that it can be rectified. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-588.1: CDAT provides a Document Issue option on the Senior Evaluation screen. 

RM-588.2: CDAT requires the user to enter a reason for selecting the Document Issue option. Comments cannot be more than 2000 characters. 

RM-588.3: CDAT requires the user to select one of the following options after entering a document issue reason: 
•	Continue working – Keeps the user on the Senior Evaluation screen 
•	Submit – Sends the doc issue comment back to the Submission Review open queue 

RM-588.4: CDAT sends the submission back to the Submission Review open queue when the Intake Senior Evaluator selects the Document Issue option. The user who initially submitted the record with the document issue at Submission Review can request it again when it is returned from Senior Evaluation. The user who initially returned the record with the document issue to Submission Review is not excluded from requesting it again at Senior Evaluation.</description>
