   <description>As an I-IVC Sr Evaluator I want to confirm if a CMS-generated attestation contains errors so that I can select all the issues associated with it. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-1459.1: CDAT requires the user to respond to the following question: 

Are there any issues with the CMS-generated Attestation? 

RM-1459.2: CDAT provides &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; options for the user to respond to the question. 

RM-1459.3: CDAT does not display the attestation invalid reasons if the user responds &quot;No&quot; to the attestation issues question.</description>
