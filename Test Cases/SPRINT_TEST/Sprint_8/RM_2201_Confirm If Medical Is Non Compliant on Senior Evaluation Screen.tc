   <description>As an Intake Sr Evaluator I want to confirm if a medical record is non-compliant so that I can select all issues associated with it. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-2201.1: CDAT displays an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) field which is selected by default and allows the user to deselect it if the record is not an EMR 

RM-2201.2: CDAT requires the user to respond to the following question: 

Are there any issues with the medical record? 

RM-2201.3: CDAT provides &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; options for the user to respond to the question which triggers the following non-compliant reasons to display when “Yes” is selected: 

• Copy quality 
• Multiple dates of service on continuous page or inpatient record 
• Multiple records with one coversheet 
• Pages out of order 
• Possible altered medical record 
• Possible PHI/PII issue (REMOVED. NEEDS TO BE ADDED TO THE ESCALATION REASON SCREEN INSTEAD) 
• Other</description>
