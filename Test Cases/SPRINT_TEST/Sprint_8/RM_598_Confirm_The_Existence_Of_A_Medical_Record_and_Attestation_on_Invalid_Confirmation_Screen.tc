   <description>&quot;As an I-IVC Sr. Evaluator user I want to confirm the existence of a medical record and attestation so that the task can be processed correctly. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-598.1: CDAT requires the user to check all options that are applicable to the submission from the following selections: 
•A CMS-Generated Attestation 
•A non-CMS-Generated Attestation 
•No Attestation 
•A medical record 
•No medical record (INV 17) 

RM-598.2: CDAT only allows the user to select one attestation option at a time. For example, if the user selects &quot;&quot;A non-CMS-Generated Attestation&quot;&quot; they cannot select &quot;&quot;A CMS-Generated Attestation&quot;&quot; and/or &quot;&quot;No Attestation&quot;&quot; at the same time. 

RM-598.3: CDAT allows the user to select &quot;&quot;A medical record&quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;No medical record (INV 17)&quot;&quot; but not both at the same time. 


RM-598.4: CDAT retains the attestation selection even if a user selects &quot;No medical record (INV 17)&quot; . 

RM-598.5: CDAT removes the ability for the user to complete the following fields when No medical record (INV 17) is selected: 
• Edit Attestation date of service 
• Select CMS-generated Attestation invalidity reasons 
• Edit Medical Record dates of service 
• Select how the Medical Record was created 
• Select issues with Medical Record 
• Answer invalidity questions 

RM-598.6: CDAT requires the user to enter a comment when No medical record (INV 17) is selected.</description>
