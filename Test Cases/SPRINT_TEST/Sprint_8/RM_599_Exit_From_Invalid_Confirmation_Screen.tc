   <description>As an I-IVC Sr. Evaluator user I want to exit the Invalid Confirmation screen so that I can leave the task without making changes. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-599.1: CDAT provides an Exit option for the user to leave the Invalid Confirmation screen. 

RM-599.2: CDAT displays the following message when the user selects the Exit option after making changes: 

&quot;Are you sure you want to Exit? All information will be lost if you do not select Save before exiting the screen.&quot; 

RM-599.3: CDAT provides the following options when the user selects the Exit option: 

•Save - saves the information entered and returns the user to the Open tab on the CCQ 
•Don't Save - returns the user to the Open tab on the CCQ without saving the information. 
•Continue Working - keeps the task open for the user to continue working 

RM-599.4: CDAT redirects the user to the CCQ without displaying an Exit message if the user has not entered any new information or made a selection in any field.</description>
