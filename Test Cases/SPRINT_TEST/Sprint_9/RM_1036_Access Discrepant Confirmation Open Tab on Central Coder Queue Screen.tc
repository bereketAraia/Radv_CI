   <description>As a Discrepant Confirmation Coder I want to access my Open queue so I can view the tasks assigned to me. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-1036.1: CDAT displays the number of requested tasks in the user's queue. The number of tasks decreases by one when the user submits or escalates a task and increases when they request a task. The number of tasks in the Open tab cannot exceed 5. 

RM-1036.2: CDAT provides the option to Request Task on the Open tab. The user has an option to select the step for which they are requesting a task. A Discrepant Confirmation Coder cannot view comments, coding entries, escalation related comments, or PM Reset comments from Focused Review. 

RM-1036.3: CDAT provides the option for a user to Search by Coversheet ID (supports partial search functionality). 

RM-1036.4 CDAT displays the following message when a search returns no results: 
&quot;No results found&quot;

- Enrollee ID 
- Reset (displays date and time of reset (MM/DD/YYYYY and time XX:XX AM EST)). CDAT displays whether submission has been PM or QA reset.

•	Invalid Confirmation 

RM-1036.7: CDAT provides a Clear All option for the user to remove a set filter.
