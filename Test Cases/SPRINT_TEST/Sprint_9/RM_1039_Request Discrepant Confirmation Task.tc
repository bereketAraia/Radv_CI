   <description>As a Discrepant Confirmation Coder I want to request a task so that I can process it. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-1039.1: CDAT provides an option to request a task from the CCQ. 

RM-1039.2: CDAT enables the Request Task option when the user selects the step they are requesting the task for. The user must select a step before the Request Task option is enabled. 

RM-1039.3: CDAT adds the task to the user's Open tab when the user selects the Request Task option. 

RM-1039.4: CDAT increases the number of tasks displayed in the Open tab when the user selects the Request Task option. For example if there are 3 tasks currently available in the user's queue and they request another then the number of tasks displayed increases to 4. 

RM-1039.5: CDAT displays the following message when the user has 5 tasks in their queue: 

- Please process at least one submission from your queue before requesting another task. 

RM-1039.6: CDAT disables the Request Task option when the user has 5 tasks in their queue. 

RM-1039.7: CDAT enables the Request Task option when the number of tasks in their queue is less than 5. 

RM-1039.8: CDAT displays the following message when there are no records available to work on in the queue: 

- There are no records available for request. Please try again later. 

RM-1039.9: A coder that submits a record at Focused Review cannot request the same task at Discrepant Confirmation. CDAT allocates a record that is associated with a different enrollee if a coder is excluded from the next available record for an enrollee.</description>
