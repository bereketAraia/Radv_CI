   <description>As a Discrepant Confirmation Coder I want to submit a task so it can be processed at the next step. 

Acceptance Criteria 

RM-1048.1: CDAT provides a Submit option on the Discrepant Confirmation screen. 

RM-1048.2: CDAT displays the following message when the user selects the Submit option: 
&quot;Are you sure you want to submit? This task cannot be recalled once it has been submitted.&quot; 

RM-1048.3: CDAT provides Yes and Cancel options for the user to confirm submission. 

RM-1048.4: If &quot;Yes&quot; is selected the task is submitted to the next step. 

RM-1048.5: If &quot;Cancel&quot; is selected the user remains on the Discrepant Confirmation screen. 

RM-1048.6: CDAT displays the following message when a user attempts to submit a record without any ICD-9 codes associated to it or without selecting No ICD-9 codes found checkbox : 

You have indicated that there are no ICD-9 codes for this record. If this is true, select &quot;No ICD-9 codes found in the submission&quot; checkbox otherwise enter ICD-9 codes. 

RM-1048.7: CDAT provides an &quot;Ok&quot; option to close the message for the user to return to the Discrepant Confirmation screen to either select &quot;No ICD-9 codes found in the submission&quot; or enter ICD-9 codes. 

RM-1048.8: CDAT moves a submission from Discrepant Confirmation to CDAT End when the user selects Submit. Any discrepant CMS-HCC will not be marked as confirmed, and the next record with that CMS-HCC will be available at Focused Review. 

RM-1048.9: An enrolleeâ€™s subsequent records previously made unavailable at Focused Review are submitted to Discrepant Confirmation once all the CMS-HCCs for the enrollee are confirmed at Discrepant Confirmation. All previously unavailable records bypass Focused Review but must go through Discrepant Confirmation.</description>
