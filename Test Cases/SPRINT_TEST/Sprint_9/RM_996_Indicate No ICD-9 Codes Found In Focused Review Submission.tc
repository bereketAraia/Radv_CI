   <description>As a Focused Review Coder I want to indicate when no ICD-9 Codes are found for a submission so that the record can be processed correctly. 

Acceptance Criteria: 

RM-996.1: CDAT provides an option for the user to select No ICD-9 codes found in the submission. 

RM-996.2: CDAT disables the Encoder Tool when the user selects No ICD-9 codes found in the submission. 

RM-996.3: CDAT displays a comments box when the user selects No ICD-9 codes found in the submission. A maximum of 2,000 characters is allowed in the comments box. 

RM-996.4: CDAT requires the user to enter a comment when &quot;No ICD-9 codes found in the submission&quot; is selected. 

RM-996.5: CDAT displays the following message when the user selects the No ICD-9 codes found in the submission option but does not enter a comment after selecting the Submit option: 

“Comments are required”. 

RM-996.6: CDAT prevents a user from submitting without having ICD-9 codes associated with the record or &quot;No ICD-9 codes found in the submission&quot; selected.</description>
